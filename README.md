# Pi4 System Timer IRQ GUI Clock

THIS BRANCH IS A BIT FREESTYLE AND HAS GRAPHIC SUPPORT to display a clock.

This is a minimal baremetal code to test system timer interrupt during
a main loop on raspberry Pi4 and aarch64.

- set clock via uart with `23:45` and return

TAKE A LOOK TO THE [Pi1 Branch](https://github.com/no-go/pi4-irq-SystemTimer/tree/someGraphics_pi1)
to compare Pi1 with Pi4 code!
